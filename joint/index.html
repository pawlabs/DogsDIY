  <h2 class="sub-head mobonly"> WHAT <i>MAKES</i> A DOG JOINT SUPPLEMENT EFFECTIVE?</h2>

  <p class=""><b>J</b>udging from the number of supplements out there, it’s possible there could be some confusion on what makes a supplement effective in the first place. To make matters worse, it's reported that over 60% of amazon reviews could be written for by paid promoters.1 2 How do you decide? Our advice is just stick to the facts.  
</p>
    <p class="p-20">Compare the key ingredients and safety of the product first over anything else. Doing your research and learning what key ingredients help your dog joint symptoms is the right place to start. Second, compare supplement brands based on those key ingredients. How digestible and easily fed the supplement to your dog is also important. Is it chewable and delicious?</p>

	 <h2 class="sub-head bolded deskonly">GLUCOSAMINE & CHONDROITIN ESSENTIAL FOR DOG ARTHRITIS & HIP DYSPLASIA</h2>
 
  
  <p class="">
Glucosamine and Chondroitin are the main natural components that make up cartilage.3 They are basically the building blocks for cartilage and are known to stimulate the body to produce more cartilage. Also, they are known to protect cells known as chondrocytes which are instrumental in maintaining the structure of the cartilage. Slowing down cartilage deterioration in joints is also something that they have the potential to do. 
</p>
    <p class="p-20">According to the College of Life Sciences, UCD Dublin, dogs who received a combination of glucosamine and chondroitin had statistically significant improvements - showing reductions in pain and the severity of the condition.

 <p class="p-20">
Therefore, really pay attention to ingredient labels when comparing different supplements. If it lacks the essential ingredients that it should possess, then that should be a deal breaker. However, as always, it's important to consult with your vet first to know how to best address your dog's condition.  Below are notable ingredients shown to be helpful in addressing joint pain for dogs as per clinical studies.

  </div>
  <div class="join-flex flex-box">
  <div class="join-left">
  	    <ul class="join-link flex-box">
  <li><strong>Glucosamine: </strong>This compound occurs naturally and is made up of Glucose (a sugar) and Glutamine (an amino acid). It helps with creating molecules that are vital in the formation of cartilage in joints so as to boost mobility and flexibility. </li>
   <li><strong>Chondroitin: </strong>  This is the main sulfate component of cartilage. It enhances cartilage elasticity, helps to retain sufficient properties for shock absorption and promotes retention of water in the joint.  </li>
   <li><strong>MSM: </strong> Otherwise known as Methylsulfonylmethane is a form of sulphur and is highly beneficial for easing joint pain, canine arthritis, and inflammation in the joint.</li>
	<!--div class="treat-effect-img term mobonly">
	<img src="../images/join-img-one.png">
	</div-->
	
    <li><strong>Turmeric: </strong> One of its components is curcumin which inhibits enzymes that are active in the process of inflammation that eventually results in painful joints. It also has antioxidant properties and antioxidants are known to reduce damage to joint cell walls thus reducing pain.  </li>
    <li><strong>Green Lipped Mussel: </strong> It is a great dietary supplement for muscles, nervous system and the heart, and also ensures healthy bones thanks to a significant amount of calcium. Similarly, it is used in treating hypocalcemia, a condition of low calcium levels.  </li>
	<li><strong>Hyaluronic Acid:</strong> : It is a main component of both the cartilage and synovial fluid that bathes the joints. The synovial fluid binds to the water and creates a thick gelatinous substance that lubricates the cartilage and protects it from wear.</li>
	 <li><strong>Calcium Carbonate:</strong> This is one of the best sources of calcium and is an essential supplement for healthy joints and muscles and strong bones. Your dog’s body cannot produce calcium on its own and basically derives it from food that your dog takes in. </li>
